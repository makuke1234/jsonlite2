A light-weight C JSON library, relying on KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple)
convention (similar to my other json library [jsonlite](https://github.com/makuke1234/jsonlite)).
This time I decided to make the C version first, translating it to C++ afterwards seemed easier to me.

Yes, this library is designed to aim for fast compilation times, simplicity,
ease of use and full compliancy with JSON standard.


# Overview

Both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows binaries of this library can be obtained [here](https://github.com/makuke1234/jsonlite2/releases). The library has been compiled with MinGW GCC and should also be compatible
with Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler and the others, since MinGW uses the same format for
C libraries.

If you want you can compile the library yourself, just use the `makefile` provided in the `c` subdirectory.


# A C++ version

Also, a sophisticated single-include C++ version of this library is being planned...
