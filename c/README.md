# jsonlite2 - C version

To start using the C version of the jsonlite2 JSON library, first choose whether you are compiling for
x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) platform.

Just include the `jsonlite2.h` header file to your project from the `include` sub-directory.
When linking there are 2 options:
* To link against the static version of the library, use `libjsonlite2.a` from the `bin` subdirectory.
* To link against the dynamic library, use `libjsonlite2.dll.a` from the `bin` subdirectory and add also the `jsonlite2.dll` to your application's path.


**Enjoy!**
